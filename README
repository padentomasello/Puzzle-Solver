    EntityType.java     SUGGESTED skeletons for other parts of the program.
    NamedEntity.java    
    Parser.java

    test-correct        Blackbox tester for correct inputs.
    test-error          Blackbox tester for erroneous inputs.

    staff-version       If we update the skeleton, this file will contain a
                        unique version id indicating what version of the
                        skeleton is currently in use.
